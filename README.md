# Addon-aircraft

This bookmarklet adds addon aircraft to GeoFS. These aircraft are not animated, so features like landing gear and afterburner use separately loaded models that may be left behind floating in midair when toggling these features.

NOTE: it is currently under development and as such **might be broken or glitchy**.

Current features:
- F/A-18C addon aircraft accessed via the livery dropdown on the Su-35 (replaces the Ho Ho Ho livery). Will have multiplayer visibility and a separate button in the aircraft menu.
- (PLANNED) Mig-17 addon aircraft. Will NOT have multiplayer visibility, otherwise the same features overall as the F/A-18C (landing gear, cockpit, etc.).
