# Addon-aircraft

This bookmarklet adds addon aircraft to GeoFS. These aircraft are not animated, so features like landing gear, cockpits, and afterburner use separately loaded models that may be left behind floating in midair when toggling these features.

NOTE: it is currently under development and as such **might be broken or glitchy**.

Current features:
- F/A-18C addon aircraft. Does NOT have a tailhook currently. Will have multiplayer visibility at some point.
- Sukhoi Su-27 Flanker addon aircraft. Slightly different from the Su-35 due to the inclusion of a speedbrake, lack of thrust vectoring, and weaker engines. Will probably add a proper, gauge-filled Su-27 cockpit at some point.

Aircraft to be added in the future:</br>
- Mig-17 addon aircraft. Will have multiplayer visibility.
- Piper Super Cub addon aircraft. Will include flaps and a more powerful engine.
- Su-33 addon aircraft. Will include folding wing animation and tailhook. (This will likely be released pretty close to the time the F/A-18C gets its tailhook).
- E-7 Wedgetail (by request of Lachy, I think). Will be a heavier P-8 with an antenna.
- Eurofighter Typhoon
- Cessna Citation
- A-4 Skyhawk
- Tupolev Tu-144

Aircraft that might be added in the future:
- Harrier Jump Jet. Based off an in-development mod that adds VTOL to the Alphajet.
